# New fork form React Native Image Cache

Because [React Native Image Cache](https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-img-cache) was no longer maintainingï¼Œ when I use this lib, the [react-native-fetch-blob](https://github.com/wkh237/react-native-fetch-blob) also was no longer maintaining. Good news, new gay fork and maintaining on [rn-fetch-blob](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob), I change react-native-img-cache code use rn-fetch-blob instead of react-native-fetch-blob.
